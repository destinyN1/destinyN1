# 👋 Hi, I’m @destinyN1

Hi there! My name is **Destiny**, and I’m a soon-to-be graduate of **Electrical & Electronic Engineering**. Welcome to my little corner of GitHub, where you’ll find a mix of projects reflecting my wide range of interests.

## 👀 Interests

I’m passionate about:
- **Hardware Design & Testing**: Exploring the ins and outs of electronics and computers.
- **Mathematics & Physics**: Teaching myself advanced concepts in my free time.
- **Computer Security & Networking**: Delving into low-level programming and better security practices.
- **Clinical Sciences**: Reading and learning about medical topics.
- **Entrepreneurship & Finance**: I'm fascinated by innovative ways to make a positive impact on the world and also possibly making a quick buck in the mean time. 

Honestly, I bounce between interests quite a lot, so you’ll probably see some **random projects** here too. Let’s see where this journey takes us!

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Cryptographic Hardware Design: Building a ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD encryption engine in SystemVerilog following full ASIC design flow
